# Forecasting?
Forecasting is a technique that uses historical data as inputs to make informed estimates that are predictive in determining the direction of future trends.
Businesses utilize forecasting to determine how to allocate their budgets or plan for anticipated expenses for an upcoming period of time. This is typically based on the projected demand for the goods and services offered.
* **Forecasting involves making predictions about the future.**
* **In finance, forecasting is used by companies to estimate earnings or other data for subsequent periods.**
* **Traders and analysts use forecasts in valuation models, to time trades, and to identify trends.**
* **Forecasts are often predicated on historical data.**
